# CORS Configuration Test

Your backend is now configured to accept requests from: `https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app`

## What Changed

1. **Flexible CORS Origins**: Backend now accepts both `https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app` and `https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app/`
2. **Debug Logging**: Server logs will show which origins are attempting to connect
3. **Production Ready**: Environment variables properly configured

## Environment Configuration

### Backend (.env)
```
PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Frontend (Vercel Environment Variable)
```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.railway.app
```

## Testing CORS

After deploying, you can test CORS by:

1. **Check Server Logs**: Look for these messages in your backend logs:
   ```
   üåê Production CORS origins: ["https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app", "https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app/"]
   üì° Request from origin: https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Browser Dev Tools**: Open your frontend and check the Network tab for:
   - No CORS errors in console
   - Successful OPTIONS preflight requests
   - Socket.IO connection established

3. **Test Endpoints**: Try accessing your backend health endpoint:
   ```
   curl -H "Origin: https://trendy-games-io.vercel.app" https://your-backend-domain.railway.app/health
   ```

## Common CORS Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "CORS policy blocked"
- **Solution**: Verify `CLIENT_URL` in backend exactly matches your frontend domain
- **Check**: No trailing slashes or protocol mismatches

### Issue: Socket.IO connection failed
- **Solution**: Ensure `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in frontend points to correct backend
- **Check**: Both frontend and backend use HTTPS in production

### Issue: Credentials not included
- **Solution**: CORS is configured with `credentials: true` - should work automatically

## Next Steps

1. Deploy your backend with the updated CORS configuration
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly on your hosting platform
3. Test the connection from your live frontend
4. Check logs for any CORS-related errors

Your CORS configuration is now properly set up to work with your Vercel frontend! üöÄ
